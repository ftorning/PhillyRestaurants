## Philly Restaurants App

## Synopsis

The app serves as a catalog of restaurants that stores images, links and menu information for each restaurant. In addition to the data already displayed, additional infomormation (ex. neighborhood) to ultimately build out additional filters as the list grows. JSON endpoints are provided to easily retrieve data.

## Motivation

This App was created to meet Project 3 requirements of the Fullstack Web Development track from Udacity. Additionally, with some improvements, it can serve as a repository for restaurant data that is easy to use and quick to update.

## Installation

To install, run database_setup.py to create a mysql database with all the necessary tables and fields. Optional: finalprojectmenus.py is a pre-made list of 10 (fantastic) restaurants to get started - Note: Once the App is up and running, logo and interior images will need to be re-added to correctly store the files in the appropriate static image folders.

Once the database has been created, run project.py to start the App.
